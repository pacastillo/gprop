              EO Evolutionary Computation Framework and Library

EO is a toolbox for evolutionary computation which defines interfaces for
many classes of algorithms used in evolutionary computation, and, at the
same time, provides some examples that use those interfaces. The client/user
can use those objects, or create their own. If new objects are created, the
GeNeura team commit themselves to test them, and make them available to the
Evolutionary Computation community. In this way, no changes have to be made
to the library or the program: just new classes added.
EO uses STL, and uses ANSI C++. So far, it's been tested and works with gcc
2.8.1 and egcs 1.0.2 in Linux, Irix, Win95/NT (with Cygwin) and Solaris
Machines, and with Visual C++ 5.0. Makefiles for Unix and project files for
NT are provided.
To start and use it, just type
bash$ configure --prefix=<current eo directory>
bash$ make
This makes the object and library files needed, makes the examples in the
examples directory, and builds the genetic mastermind application. Then, to
unzip the documentation
bash$ make docunzip
which unzips the HTML documentation into the doc directory.
If you have got any problem, write to any of the addresses below, or just do

bash$ make bug-report
and tell us your problem, indicating eo release, the C++ compiler you are
using, and the platform.
The latest versions of EO are always available from
http://etcpc8.ugr.es/~jmerelo/eo and ftp://etcpc8.ugr.es/pub/eo.

For a quick dive into the eo library, check the SGA
Then go ahead to the EasyGA, which is a more flexible implementation of a
Genetic Algorithm.
Then, why not, see how EO implements Simulated Annealing.

If you have uncompressed the docs, all this is in your doc directory
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you have any problem, have created a new class, or just want to tell us
something, write to eo@kal-el.ugr.es. The eo mailing list is
eodev@kal-el.ugr.es, send an e-mail to j@kal-el.ugr.es if you want to join.

Legal Stuff

EO is free and free distribution; however, if you include parts of EO in a
commercial product, you have to request authorization from us.
The usual things apply too. If it does not work, if your wife or dogs
abandons you, or your room humector stops working, it's not our fault.

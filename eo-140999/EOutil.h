/** @name Utility classes
\begin{center} Utilities for EO \end{center}
Utilities are not exactly within EO, that is, they are not related to
evolutionary computation algorithms; however, they are useful for
evolutionary algorithms: allow to extract information from them,
represent them, generate random numbers in a platform-independent way, and so on.\\

This is a wide class in which more user-provided algorithms 
could be added.

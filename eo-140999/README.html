<H1>EO Evolutionary Computation Framework and Library: README</H1></CENTER>

<p>EO (Evolvable|Evolutionary objects) is a C++ toolbox for evolutionary
    computation which defines interfaces for  
many classes of algorithms used in evolutionary computation, and, at the
same time, provides some examples that use those interfaces. The client/user
can include those objects in his or her programs, or create their
    own. If new objects are created, the <a
href=http://geneura.ugr.es>GeNeura team</a> commit themselves to test
them, and make them available 
to the Evolutionary Computation community. In this way, no changes have
to be made to the library design or to a program that implements an EC
algorithm: just new classes added. Our intention would be that, in the
future, somebody implementing an EC algorithm would say "I am using
EO, plus a class that hs been made publicly available", improving
repeatability of EC results and easing its availability. 
<BR>EO uses STL, and ANSI C++. So far, it has been tested and works
with gcc 2.8.1 and egcs 1.0.2 in Linux, Irix, Win95/NT (with Cygwin) and
Solaris Machines, and with Visual C++ 5.0 in WinNT machines. Makefiles for Unix and project
files and makefiles for NT are provided.</p>


    <h2>Installing EO and compiling examples in UNIX</h2>
To start and use it, first you can untar or unzip it (depending on the distribution you got), by doing, 
<BR><TT>bash$ zcat eo-x.y.z.tgz | tar xvf -</TT><BR>
or
<BR><TT>bash$ unzip eo-x.y.z.zip</TT></P>
<P>
Once everything is decompressed to the eo-x.y.z directory (whatever
x, y and z mean for the current release), <TT>cd</TT> to it and  type
<BR><TT>bash$ configure</TT><br>
or 
<BR><TT>bash$ configure --prefix=/my/fav/directory</TT><br>
if you intend to use it from another directory. If you do so, you´ll
have then to copy manually all the <TT>.h</TT> and <TT>.a</TT> files
to it. Right now, EO is mostly templates-based, so it has mainly got
header files, plus a small and independent utility library.</P> 
<P> After that, type
<BR><TT>bash$ make</TT>
<script>
function generadir( e, name, host ) {
e.href="mailto:"+name+"@"+host+".ugr.es";
}
</script>
<BR>This makes the object and library files needed, makes the examples
in the <TT>apps/examples</TT> directory, and builds the genetic mastermind
    application in the <TT>apps/master</TT> directory. If anything
goes wrong at this stage, <A HREF="#"  onclick="generadir( this,
'todos', 'geneura' ); return true;">e-mail us</A>. It should work
properly with the compilers mentioned so far. 
</P>
<p>Then, to unzip the documentation
<BR><TT>bash$ make docunzip</TT>
<BR>which unzips the HTML documentation into the <TT>doc</TT> directory.</p>
<P>If there is any problem, write to any of the addresses below, or
just do
<BR><TT>bash$ make bug-report</TT>
<BR>and tell us your problem, indicating EO release, the C++ compiler you
are using, and the platform.
</P>

<h2>Installing EO and compiling examples in Win95/NT</h2>

Unzip the library to your favorite directory by double-clicking on the eo-x.y.z icon, and then load  <tt> apps/examples/examples.dsw </tt> or <tt>
      apps/examples/master.dsw </tt> workspaces; then define the main
    directory you installed it to as default include directory (in
    tools->directories or somesuch) and press F7 for compiling. Alternatively, if you favor makefiles, change into the apps/examples directory and run<br>
<TT>C:\my\dir\eo-0.x.y.z\apps\examples> nmake /f examples.mak</TT><BR>
which will create debug executables for all the examples. </P>

<P> In the <em>CygWin environment</em>, everything should work in the same way as in UNIX, but for a couple of things. To run configure, type<br>
<tt>bash$ sh ./configure</tt>, or, much better, create a <TT>\bin</TT> directory and copy sh.exe to it; that way, shell scripts will work properly.</P>

<h2>Availability</h2>
The latest versions of EO are always available from <A HREF="http://geneura.ugr.es/~jmerelo/EO.html ">http://geneura.ugr.es/~jmerelo/EO.html</A>
and <A HREF="ftp://geneura.ugr.es/pub/eo">ftp://geneura.ugr.es/pub/eo. </A>


<H2>Working with EO</H2>
For a quick dive into the EO library, check the <A HREF="http://geneura.ugr.es/~jmerelo/eo/ASimpleGeneticAlgorithm.html">SGA</A>
<BR>Then go ahead to the <A HREF="http://geneura.ugr.es/~jmerelo/eo/DefiningGAstheeasyway.html">EasyGA,</A>
which is a more flexible implementation of a Genetic Algorithm.
<BR>Then, why not, see how EO implements Simulated Annealing in <A HREF="http://geneura.ugr.es/~jmerelo/eo/EOSimAnnAlg.html">EOSimAnnAlg</A>. If you have unzipped the documentation, there should be also <A HREF="doc/index.html">local copies</A> of these files.


<H2>Tell us something!</H2>
If you have any problem, have created a new class, or just want to
tell us something, write to <A HREF="#"  onclick="generadir( this,
'todos', 'geneura' ); return true;">us</A>.

<H2>Legal Stuff</H2>
EO is free and free distribution; however, if you include parts of EO in
a commercial product, you have to request authorization from us.
<BR>The usual things apply too. If it does not work, if your wife or dogs
abandons you, or your room humector stops working, it's not our fault.
